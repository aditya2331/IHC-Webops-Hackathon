# IHC Webops Hackathon PS1

## **Description**

### I have built a simple, lightweight hostel complaint portal using flask and sqlite where users can create an account, login, and submit complaints regarding their hostel, via a form. These can optionally be anonymous as well, since users aren't forced to submit all credentials. Users can also see their past complaints in the dashboard. With more time, I was looking to implement an admin feature where the admin can change the status of resolution of complaints, which would be reflected on the users' dashboard.

## **Activation**
### First, activate the virtual environment (use the command 'source venv/bin/activate' on MacOS). Then run the command 'flask run'. This will open development server http://127.0.0.1:5000.
